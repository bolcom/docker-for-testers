= Install SDKman

**The appendices are for small guides to help people who don't have the prerequisites of the labs get up to speed fast.
Also additional reading material can be added here or anything else that you would like to keep out of your normal chapters and labs.
See the examples below:**

Install http://sdkman.io[SDKman],
a Software Development Kit Manager focussed on simplifying
the installation and versioning of JVM based tools.

It supports a bunch of JVM based tools like
Groovy, Scala, Grails, Play, Spring Boot, Ant, and much more.
You can have multiple versions of each tool installed,
easily switch between them on-the-fly without manual environment variable magic,
and all this is kept inside your own `$HOME` directory.

See http://sdkman.io/install.html on how to install it
(it's a one-liner, really)
