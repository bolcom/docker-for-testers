= Docker for testers

**The purpose of this training is to learn how to use Docker on your local machine.**

At the end of the day you will have learned:

* Starting and stopping of containers
* Building your own images
* Running your own test database with test data
* Running your own Selenium Grid for web testing

The training is structured as such: first theory, followed by practice, with every step building on the previous step.
