== Dealing with named containers
You can start named containers by adding `--name your_name` to any docker run command. If you try to start a new instance of a container with that same name you will get an error message.

 docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The name "/pg" is already in use by container. You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name..

This is easily resolved by running

 docker rm -f <container_name>

or add the --rm flag when starting the container, which will delete the container as soon as it stops.
