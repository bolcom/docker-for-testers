= Running Docker containers
**This assignment focuses on the Docker commands necessary to start, stop and inspect containers.** +

We will use a Docker image published in the Docker Hub to start a small web server that serves a single "Hello World!"-page.

.Start a container running a webserver
----
docker run -d -P training/webapp python app.py
----

.List the details of the newest container
----
docker ps -l
----

.Find your container ID in the output
image:docker-ps.png[width=2000,height=74]

.Check out the website!
----
Go to http://localhost:32769 (the port number left of the -> in the docker ps command output)
----
NOTE: If you are using Docker Toolbox, you may have to go to http://<docker ip>:<port> instead. Run *docker-machine ip default* to find the IP. Run *docker-machine ls* to find out the name of your Docker Machine.

The site should say "Hello world!".

== Inspecting the logs
After you've seen the "Hello world"-message you might want to inspect the logs of the docker container with the *logs* command.

.Show the logs
----
docker logs <container id or name>
----
You should see GET commands on the root (/) of your webserver.

== Passing environment variables to a container
Most containers are configurable through environment variables that you can pass to the container when starting with the *-e flag*.
Let's pass your name to the application by using the environment variables of the container, so it will be shown when you visit the website.

NOTE: Environment variables are a set of dynamic named values that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. They are part of the environment in which a process runs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable[Wikipedia]

.Start a container with an environment variable
----
docker run -d -P -e PROVIDER="Your name" training/webapp python app.py
----

Find out the port for this new container using the command below and visit it again to see your name displayed.

.Find the mapped port for exposed port (5000) on the container
----
docker port <container id returned by previous docker run command> 5000
----

== Run more containers
.Execute the run command a couple of more times, followed by docker ps
----
docker run -d -P training/webapp python app.py
docker ps
----
Notice that every container has a different port assigned, but all map to 5000 port on the container. This is handled by the -P parameter.

----
-P, --publish-all     Publish all exposed ports to random ports
----

Of course, at times you may want to have more control over the ports you are running on.

Figure out how to start another training/webapp container mapping a specific port (80) to the exposed port of the container (5000).
Afterwards you should be able to see the Hello-message on http://localhost:80.

NOTE: Start by checking the documentation of the run command: *docker run --help*
