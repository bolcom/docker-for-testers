= Managing containers
*After the first two exercises we have a number of containers running, which we will probably want to stop at some point in time. Let's practice that now.*

== Stopping containers
First we have to figure out which containers are currently running with `docker ps`.

.Listing all running containers
----
docker ps
----
image:docker-ps-2.png[width=2000,height=200]

You can stop a single container by running `docker stop` followed by the container id or name.

.Stopping a single container
----
docker stop a557431a5588
----

You can also specify and stop multiple containers.

.Stopping multiple containers
----
docker stop a557431a5588 clever_fermi
----

.Stop all containers at once
Of course, you might also want to stop all containers at once. To do so, we'd have to pass all the container ids we want to stop to the `stop` command. We can achieve this by combining two commands.

.Output all the container ids of currently running containers
----
docker ps -q
----
****
[TIP]
Run `docker ps --help` to find out what the `-q` flag does.
****

By combining the output of the `ps` command with the `stop` commands we can easily stop all containers with one statement.

.Linux/Mac OS X/Windows (Cygwin)
----
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
----

.Windows (DOS Prompt)
----
FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('docker ps -q') DO docker stop %i
----

If you now run `docker ps` the list of containers should be empty.

== Removing containers

Now that we've stopped all the containers we can also remove them. Let's see how many stopped containers we have on our system by running `docker ps -a`.

.Listing stopped containers
----
docker ps -a
----
****
[TIP]
Run `docker ps --help` to find out what the `-a` flag does.
****
You can remove a container by running `docker rm` followed by its container id or name.

.Removing a container
----
docker rm big_newton
----

.Removing all containers
Of course, in this case we'd rather remove all containers at once

.Linux/Mac OS X/Windows (Cygwin)
----
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
----
.Windows (DOS Prompt)
----
FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('docker ps -a -q') DO docker rm %i
----
If you now list all stopped containers again, `docker ps -a`, no containers should be returned.This does *not* mean that the images are no longer available, as you can see by running `docker images`. We've only removed the containers which are, in essence, instances of the images available on your system.
