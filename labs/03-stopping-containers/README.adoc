= Managing containers
*After exercise 1 and 2 we have a number of containers running, which we will probably want to stop at some point in time. Let's practice that now.*

First we have to figure out which containers are currently running with `docker ps`.

== Stopping containers
.Listing all running containers
----
docker ps
----
image:docker-ps-2.png[width=2000,height=200]

You can stop a single container by running `docker stop` followed by the container id or name.

.Stopping a single container
----
docker stop a557431a5588
----

You can also specify and stop multiple containers.

.Stopping multiple containers
----
docker stop a557431a5588 clever_fermi
----

Of course, you might also want to stop all containers at once. We can do this by passing the output of the `ps` command to the `stop` command.

.docker ps flags
----
docker ps -a -q
----

Run `docker ps --help` to find out what the `-a` and `-q` flags do. You might have noticed this is exactly the output we need to feed to the stop command

.docker stop
Linux/Mac OS X/Windows (Cygwin)
----
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
----

Windows (DOS Prompt)
----
FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('docker ps -a -q') DO docker stop %i
----

If you now run `docker ps` the list of containers should be empty.

== Removing containers

Now that we've stopped all the containers we can also remove them. Let's see how many stopped containers we have on our system by running `docker ps -a`.

.Listing stopped containers
----
docker ps -a
----

You can remove a container by running `docker rm` followed by its container id or name.

.Stopping a container
----
docker rm big_newton
----

Of course, in this case we'd rather remove all containers at once

.Removing all containers
Linux/Mac OS X/Windows (Cygwin)
----
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
----
Windows (DOS Prompt)
----
FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('docker ps -a -q') DO docker rm %i
----
If you now list all stopped containers again, `docker ps -a`, no containers should be returned.This does *not* mean that the images are no longer available, as you can see by running `docker images`. We've only removed the containers which are, in essence, instances of the images available on your system.
