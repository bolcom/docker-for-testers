= Checking whether the webpage is displayed correctly
*Spinning up your own Selenium containers can be convenient if you want to test a site with a specific browser and don't want to bother with configuration of machines.*

In this exercise we will run our `webserver` and verify that the displayed page has the correct content, using a browser supplied by Selenium.

== Preparing the test environment
image:container-overview.png[width=380,height=350]

For the automated check to succeed we need to create the following situation:

. The `database` container is running and has data
. `webserver` is able to connect to the `database`
. Selenium grid is running
. The Java environment to execute the tests will be provided by a Docker container too

== Starting the selenium server
Assuming you have the `database` and `webserver` containers running, start the Selenium server by executing:
----
docker run --rm --name selenium -d --network training -p 4444:4444 -p 5900:5900 selenium/standalone-firefox-debug
----

== Connect with VNC
In order to monitor test progress we can connect with https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/[VNC viewer, window="_blank"] to the Selenium node after we've started it.
The VNC server is listening on port 5900, the password is `secret`.

== Adjust SimpleTest
We've prepared a simple Java project to test whether the `webserver` displays the correct message.
Adjust the message you added to the database in the SimpleTest.java file. This file can be found inside the selenium-grid-docker directory.

== Execute your test
We will use the official https://hub.docker.com/_/maven/[Maven, window="_blank"] image (`maven:3.3.9-jdk-8-alpine`) to build and execute our test.

This image provides a Java environment and Maven (a Java build tool) to execute the project. In order to make the project files, which are on your local machine, available to the container we will mount the `selenium-grid-docker` directory as a https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#/mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume[volume, window="_blank"] for the container.

[NOTE]
Make sure that your command prompt is in the `selenium-grid-docker` directory.

.Execute this command to start the test
 docker run -it --rm --name my-maven-project --network training -v "$PWD":/usr/src/mymaven -w /usr/src/mymaven maven:3.3.9-jdk-8-alpine mvn clean install

=== Additional Windows/Docker toolbox details
NOTE: On Windows/GIT Bash/Cygwin you may get the following error `the input device is not a TTY. If you are using mintty, try prefixing the command with 'winpty'`.
Run the command again with `winpty` in front of it. Refer to this http://willi.am/blog/2016/08/08/docker-for-windows-interactive-sessions-in-mintty-git-bash/[page, window="_blank"] for details.

NOTE: Before we can mount a volume on Windows when using Docker Machine we need to make a shared folder in Virtual Box first. See step 3 of this https://blog.pavelsklenar.com/5-useful-docker-tip-and-tricks-on-windows/[page, window="_blank"].

== Considerations

  What are the implications of the `-v` flag in the command?
