= Running your database with data included

*Having to insert the data every time you start a container can become a hassle. In this exercise we will create our own version of the Postgres image and bake our data into it. That way the data will always be available on startup.*

The https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/[Postgres, window="_blank"] image provides a convenient way to execute scripts on startup of your database. All we have to do is add a `.sh` script to the `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d-folder`. Follow the steps below for detailed instructions.

[NOTE]
If you still have containers running, please stop them now.

== Build & run the image

Follow the steps below to create your own version of the Postgres image, including the files necessary to create the data we will access from the `webserver`.

- Create an empty folder
. Save the shell script below in that folder as `create.sh`
----
#!/bin/bash
set -e

psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --username "$POSTGRES_USER" <<-EOSQL
    CREATE DATABASE eurostar;
    \c eurostar
    CREATE TABLE kv (key varchar(100) PRIMARY KEY, value varchar(100));
    INSERT INTO kv VALUES ('provider','Now getting data from Postgres!');
EOSQL
----
- Create a `Dockerfile` in the folder that
.. Is built https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/from[from, window="_blank"] postgres:9
.. https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/add[Adds, window="_blank"] the `.sh` file to the `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` folder in the container. Postgres will run any *.sql files and source any *.sh scripts found in this directory to do further initialization before starting the service.
- Build the image with the name `database`
- Run the newly build image as part of the training network
- Run a `webserver` container and also make it part of the training network

You should see the message 'Now getting data from Postgres!' if you visit the web app.

[NOTE]
On Windows you may have to run https://waterlan.home.xs4all.nl/dos2unix.html#DOS2UNIX[dos2unix, window="_blank"] on your .sh file before you can build the image. This will fix the line-endings in the script and allow it to be executed by the database image. Alternatively you can open the .sh file in Notepad++ and change the line endings to UNIX style.
