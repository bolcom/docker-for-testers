= Running your database with data included

*Having to insert the data every time you start a container can become a hassle. In this exercise we will bake our data into the Postgres image so that it will be available on startup.*

The https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/[Postgres] image provides a convenient way to execute scripts on startup of your database. All we have to do is add a `.sh` script to the `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d-folder` as per the documentation of the image.

[NOTE]
If you still have containers running, please stop them now.

== Build & run the image

Follow the steps below to create your own version of the Postgres image, including the files necessary to create the data we need for the `testnetapp`.

- Create an empty folder
. Save the shell script below in that folder as `create.sh`
----
#!/bin/bash
set -e

psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --username "$POSTGRES_USER" <<-EOSQL
    CREATE DATABASE testnet;
    \c testnet
    CREATE TABLE kv (key varchar(100) PRIMARY KEY, value varchar(100));
    INSERT INTO kv VALUES ('provider','Now getting data from Postgres!');
EOSQL
----
- Create a `Dockerfile` in the folder that
.. Is built https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/from[from] postgres:9
.. https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/add[Adds] the `.sh` file to the `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` folder in the container
- Build the image and run it as part of the training network
- Run the `testnetapp` and make it part of the training network

You should see the message 'Now getting data from Postgres!' if you visit the web app.

[NOTE]
On Windows you may have to run dos2unix on your .sh file before you can build the image. This will fix the line-endings in the script and allow it to be executed by the database image.
