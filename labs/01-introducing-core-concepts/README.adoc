= Lab 1: Core Concepts in Practice

**The focus of this first lab is to experience the core concepts that were explained in the introduction in practice.** +
**This would also be the place to let people experience how people used to reach their goals without the technology that your training is about.** +
**Please state where the base project of the first lab can be found and what it does.**

Let's do this.
In `labs/01-introducing-core-concepts` you can find the first lab.

Here you've got a simple "hello world" application,
written in Java.

[TIP]
====
* Which command(s) do you need to execute,

== Exercise 2

**Labs belong to a chapter, and exercises to a lab. So it's possible to have multiple exercises in 1 lab. Please explain exercise 2 here.**

== Resources

**This would be the place to link to resources that can help people solve the exercises, preferably from the official documentation pages so people learn to read the docs.**
